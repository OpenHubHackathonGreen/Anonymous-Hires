# Anonymous-Hires

This project was part of the [HvTechFest Hackathon 2021](https://hvtechfest.com/hackathon). 

The idea is to build a web platform for employers and employees, where the employer hires employees anonymously purely based on their talent. Through this project we are in hopes of tackling racial descrimination and gender biases.
